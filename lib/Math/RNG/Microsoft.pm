=head1 NAME

Math::RNG::Microsoft - a pseudo-random number generator compatible
with Visual C.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Math::RNG::Microsoft;

    my $randomizer = Math::RNG::Microsoft->new(seed => 24);

    my $random_digit = $randomizer->rand_max(10);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a random number generator used by L<Games::ABC_Path::Generator>, which
emulates the one found in Microsoft's Visual C++. It was utilised here, out
of familiarity and accessibility, because it is commonly used to generate
Freecell layouts in the Freecell world (see
L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell_%28Windows%29> ).

B<NOTE:> This is not a cryptologically secure random number generator,
nor is it a particularly good one, so its use is discouraged unless
compatibility with the Windows C Run-time-library is needed.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.0.1

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

The constructor. Accepts a numeric seed as an argument.

    my $randomizer = Math::RNG::Microsoft->new(seed => 1);

=head2 $randomizer->rand()

Returns a random integer from 0 up to 0x7fff - 1.

    my $n = $randomizer->rand()

=head2 $randomizer->max_rand($max)

Returns a random integer in the range 0 to ($max-1).

    my $n = $randomizer->max_rand($max);
    # $n is now between 0 and $max - 1.

=head2 $randomizer->seed($seed)

Can be used to re-assign the seed of the randomizer (though not recommended).

=head2 my $array_ref = $randomizer->shuffle(\@array)

Shuffles the array reference of the first argument, B<destroys it> and returns
it. This is using the fisher-yates shuffle.
